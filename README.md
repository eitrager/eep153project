The Green Revolution (1940sâ€“1970s) refers to a period of agricultural transformation driven by the adoption of high-yield crop varieties, improved irrigation systems, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and modern farming techniques. In Asia, this technological change significantly impacted nations like India, Pakistan, and the Philippines, where staple crops such as rice and wheat were central to diets. Key innovations included the introduction of high-yielding varieties (HYVs), such as IR8 rice, and significant investments in agricultural infrastructure.

The Green Revolution was instrumental in addressing food shortages and averting famines in Asia, particularly during the mid-20th century. For instance, India's wheat production doubled between 1965 and 1972, turning the country from a food importer to self-sufficient.

***Impact on Population, Demographics, and Sustainability***
The Green Revolution inhibited the cycle predicted by Malthus, where population growth was constrained by food shortages. By drastically increasing food availability, it supported population growth by reducing starvation and improving health conditions. This also contributed to larger population densities, particularly in rural agricultural areas.

Additionally, with improved nutrition and reduced mortality rates, fertility rates initially remained high, contributing to rapid population growth. Over time, however, economic development and urbanization led to a demographic transition with declining fertility rates in many Asian countries.
